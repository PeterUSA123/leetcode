# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
#
# For example,
# Given [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
# The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
#
# Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
#
# Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
