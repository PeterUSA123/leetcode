# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
#
# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
#
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
